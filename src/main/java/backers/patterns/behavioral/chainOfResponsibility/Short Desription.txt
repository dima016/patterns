Chain of Responsibility is a design pattern consisting of “a source of command objects and a series of processing objects”.
Each processing object in the chain is responsible for a certain type of command, and the processing is done,
it forwards the command to the next processor in the chain.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is handy for:
    * Decoupling a sender and receiver of a command
    * Picking a processing strategy at processing-time
